LaTeX is a powerful typesetting system, used for 
producing scientific and mathematical 
documents of high typographic quality. Unlike
WYSIWYG tools such as FrameMaker and Word,
it uses plain text files that contain formatting
commands. It's big, open source, stable and used
by many technical publishing companies. It's
also relatively unknown in the technical writing
community. This article overviews LaTeX, and
directs you to sources of information.
	
History
	
Donald E Knuth (www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth) 
designed a typesetting program
called TeX in the 1970s especially for complex
mathematical text. LaTeX is a macro package
that allows authors to use TeX easily, and uses
TeX as its formatting engine. It is available for
most operating systems; for example, you can
use it on low-specification PCs and Macs, as well
as on powerful UNIX and VMS systems. There
are many different implementations of LaTeX.
	
Who uses it?

I first came across LaTeX in 1992, when fellow
students were using it to write academic papers
and theses. These days, it is widely used in
the technical publishing industry for academic
journals, particularly by mathematicians,
physicists and other people who have complex
notational requirements. For example, Elsevier,
IEEE and the Royal Society all provide author
guidelines for people who use LaTeX. One of
my clients uses LaTeX to produce software
documentation (see pages 18–20 of the Autumn
2005 Communicator) and so I needed to learn it.
